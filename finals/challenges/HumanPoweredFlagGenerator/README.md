Human Powered Flag Generator

PPC challenge disguised as a Mobile challenge.
Challenge is to figure out the last 3 non zero digits of the product of 5^k factorial, k goes from `2^1 to 2^12` down to 1.

There is a nice pattern that the last 3 non zero digits of 5**k factorial cycles with a period of 4 as k increases (with the exception of k=1).
